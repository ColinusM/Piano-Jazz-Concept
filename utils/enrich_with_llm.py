    prompt = f"""Analyze this Piano Jazz Concept video and extract metadata for THIS SPECIFIC SONG.

Video Title: {video_title}
Video Description (with timestamps): {video_description}
Song Title: {song_title}
Current Composer: {current_composer or "Unknown"}

IMPORTANT CONTEXT CLUES:
- If video title has "feat." or mentions multiple artists (e.g., "feat. Jacob Collier et Mark Priore"), these are FEATURED artists being ANALYZED/COMPARED
- When multiple songs are timestamped, each song may have a DIFFERENT composer from the featured list
- Look at the song title and match it to the appropriate composer
- The PERFORMER is who plays piano in this video (usually Ã‰tienne GuÃ©reau or mentioned in description)
- The COMPOSER is who originally wrote THIS specific song

SMART MATCHING RULES:
1. If the video compares works by multiple composers, match the song title to the correct composer
2. Example: Video "feat. Collier et Priore" with songs "OrphÃ©e" and "Hajanga" - determine which composer wrote which song
3. Use your knowledge of who wrote what song when available
4. Don't just copy all names to all songs - BE SPECIFIC to THIS song

Extract from TWO SOURCES:
1. Text above (primary)
2. Your knowledge (secondary - use for composition dates, correct attribution, etc.)

Return JSON with ACCURATE, SONG-SPECIFIC data:
{{
    "performer": "who plays piano in THIS video",
