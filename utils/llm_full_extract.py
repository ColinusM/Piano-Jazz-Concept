    prompt = f"""You are analyzing a Piano Jazz Concept YouTube video to catalog which songs/pieces have been analyzed.

VIDEO TITLE: {video_title}
VIDEO URL: {video_url}
FULL DESCRIPTION:
{video_description}

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Piano Jazz Concept is √âtienne Gu√©reau's educational jazz channel
- NEVER list √âtienne as "performer" - he's the analyst/demonstrator, NOT the artist to catalog
- Focus on WHICH ARTISTS' RECORDINGS are being analyzed/discussed
- If title says "avec Brad Mehldau" ‚Üí Brad is the featured performer
- If analyzing a specific song/artist clearly ‚Üí extract that song
- If comparing multiple artists' versions ‚Üí create SEPARATE entries for each

IMPORTANT - BE CONSERVATIVE:
- ONLY extract songs that are CLEARLY mentioned in title or description
- If video is theory/discussion with NO SPECIFIC SONGS ‚Üí return empty array []
- DO NOT make up songs or use generic examples
- DO NOT default to any particular song if unclear
- If unsure ‚Üí return empty array []

YOUR TASK:
Extract ALL songs/pieces analyzed in this video with MAXIMUM metadata.

Use THREE sources:
1. Video title/description to identify songs and artists
2. Your training data to fill gaps and add context
3. Your knowledge of jazz history, famous recordings, albums, etc.

EXTRACT EVERYTHING (but only if songs are clearly present):
- Song title (MUST be explicitly mentioned in title/description)
- Composer(s)
- Performer/Artist (whose recording/version is being analyzed - NEVER √âtienne)
  - From title: "avec Brad Mehldau" ‚Üí Brad Mehldau
  - From description: "analyse du solo de Coltrane" ‚Üí John Coltrane
  - If song mentioned but no performer ‚Üí use your knowledge to identify famous version
  - If no specific recording mentioned ‚Üí leave null
- Original artist (if it's a cover/arrangement)
- Album name (if mentioned OR if you know which famous album)
- Record label (if you know it)
- Recording year (if mentioned OR if you know the famous recording year)
- Composition year
- Style/genre
- Era/decade
- Featured artists (all artists mentioned in title/description)
- Context notes (analyzing specific recording? comparing versions? theory video?)
- Timestamp (if provided)

MULTIPLE VERSIONS:
If video compares/analyzes multiple artists' versions, create SEPARATE entries

NO LIMITATIONS:
Add as much information as you can from your training data. If you know the song:
- Famous recordings and their details
- Historical context
- Notable musicians
- Anything valuable for cataloging

Return JSON array:
- If songs found: return array with song objects
- If NO songs mentioned/analyzed: return empty array []
- Even if single song, return array with 1 item

Example response:
[
  {{
    "song_title": "song name",
    "composer": "who wrote it",
    "performer": "whose recording is analyzed (NEVER √âtienne)",
    "original_artist": "if it's a cover",
    "album": "album name if known",
    "record_label": "label if known",
    "recording_year": year or null,
    "composition_year": year or null,
    "style": "genre/style",
    "era": "decade/era",
    "featured_artists": ["artist1", "artist2"],
    "timestamp": "MM:SS or null",
    "context_notes": "context about this analysis",
    "additional_info": "anything else valuable"
  }}
